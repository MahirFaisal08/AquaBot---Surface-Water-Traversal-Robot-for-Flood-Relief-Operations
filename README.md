## Overview
**AquaBot** is a surface water traversal robot designed to assist in **flood relief operations**, **underwater inspection**, and **environmental monitoring**.  
It enables safe exploration and data collection in aquatic environments that may be dangerous or inaccessible to humans.

The robot is capable of performing **autonomous navigation**, **inspection**, and **maintenance** tasks — supporting flood rescue teams by surveying submerged areas and collecting vital information.

## ⚙️ Components Used

1. **Receiver Transmitter (2.4GHz)** – For wireless control  
2. **30A Brush ESC** – Controls motor speed and direction  
3. **0.9 mA Battery** – Powers the entire robot  
4. **Servo Motor** – Enables directional control (Zed engine movement)  
5. **Metal Gear Shaft** – Transmits motor torque to propeller efficiently

## 🔧 Setup & Working

- The main body structure was built using **cockshit** (lightweight floating material).  
- A **servo motor** and **Zed engine** were placed inside the robot body for propulsion and steering.  
- The **receiver**, connected to the **FlySky transmitter**, provides 6 control channels for movement and stability.  
- **ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)** regulates the motor speed and connects through channel 2.  
- The **servo motor**, connected to channel 4, controls the Zed engine direction.  
- The **metal gear shaft** ensures smooth torque transfer between motor and propeller.

## Challenges Faced

- The **ESC burnt out** after prolonged operation due to overheating.  
- Balancing waterproofing with heat dissipation proved challenging.  
- Maintaining signal stability during high-frequency transmission required tuning.  

---

## Future Improvements

- Integrate **autonomous path planning** with onboard sensors (e.g., sonar, LIDAR).  
- Add **GPS navigation** for precise movement during flood operations.  
- Improve **ESC cooling** system to prevent burnouts.  
- Include **real-time video streaming** for live rescue monitoring.  
- Use **solar-assisted charging** for longer runtime in remote environments.  

---

## Applications

- **Flood Relief Operations:** Rescue and resource delivery during disasters.  
- **Underwater Research:** Exploration of aquatic ecosystems, shipwrecks, and submerged structures.  
- **Maintenance & Inspection:** Infrastructure inspection for pipelines, cables, and ports.  
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Water quality analysis and pollution tracking.
